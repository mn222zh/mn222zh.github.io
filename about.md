### About the site

This site was built as a first exam assignment in the course "Client-based webprogramming" at Linnaeus university. 
Jekyll is used for preprocessing and redering HTML and CSS-files.  

A few minor modifications has been done to the basic theme of Jekyll, some gfx added, disqus added to posts - and here we go.

Time will tell if I'll continue adding functions to this site/blog

During this cource I have been introduced to the markdown file-format. This text, as well as the posts in the blog are
written using MD-formated text. I guess that the evolution of html more or less forced something like markdown
to be developed. It's quite fun, because when I first was introduced to html back in the early 90'th, the text written
in html looked very much like the md-files I write here today. Less is more..

### About Me

45 years old male, living with my family 15 km east of Kalmar, working as system engineer with mainframes and windows servers.
Used to program assembler on commodore-computers in the 80th and 90th, but hasn't done any real programming for years.

One of the last things I coded was a HTML-reader for the C64 in 1992. It handled the basic tags in HTML 1.1, but I guess it would
render the output from a markdown-file just fine. Quite ok for a 30 year old computer, running at 1 MHz, with 64km of memory...

Happy Hack'in
