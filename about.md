This site was built as a first exam assignment in the course "Client-based webprogramming" at Linnaeus university. 
Jekyll is used for preprocessing and redering HTML and CSS-files.  

A few minor modifications has been done to the basic theme of Jekyll, some gfx added, disqus added to posts - and here we go.

Time will tell if I'll continue adding functions to this site/blog

Regards,
//Magnus
